# Virtual Protocol's Audio-to-Animation (A2A) Bittensor Subnet

*News: The A2A Bittensor Subnet is now on the subnet with uid X! Please join the [Bittensor Discord](https://discord.gg/RXST8svz) and see us at Channel X! Please also check our [X]() for our vision of creating an avenue where everyone can contribute to creating the best open-source A2A models.  30th April 2024*

## Introduction
Audio-to-Animation (A2A), also referred to as audio-driven animation, generates visuals that dynamically respond to audio inputs. This technology finds applications across a wide range of domains including gaming AI agents, livestreaming AI idols, virtual companions, metaverses, and more.

This Bittensor subnet offers a platform for democratizing the creation of A2A models, gathering the help of the wider ML community in Bittensor to generate the best animated motions and bring life to on-chain AI agents.

### Roadmap
We will divide the development of A2A models into several phases, with an iterative approach to make it better over time.

- **Phase 1**: Focus on generating full body motions, such as dance movements, based on the audio input from a specific curated dataset.
- **Phase 2**: Recognise the mood and genre of the audio input and adjust the generated animation accordingly.
- **Phase 3**: Expands models capabilities beyond dance audio and motions to general animation motions (i.e. gestures etc.).
- **Phase 4**: Optimize models for real-time interaction capabilities.

### Status
Currently, we're at Phase 1, where audio-to-dance motions will be the focus. Validators will choose a prompt from the reference library and send the prompt to miners for generation of animation outputs.

## Mechanism
![mechanism](docs/images/a2a-mechanism.png)
1. **Subnet owner:** Virtual Protocol as the subnet owner, creates the modules for miners and validators to train and evaluate the generated animation. Subnet Owner also decides on the parameters involved in evaluating the animation’s performance. 
2. **Miners:** Generate animations with A2A models using reference models or other models.
3. **Validators:** Provide audio prompts to miners and evaluate the submitted animation from miners based on the parameters suggested by the subnet owner. 
4. **Bittensor protocol:** Aggregate weights using Yuma Consensus and determine the final weights and allocation ratios for each miner and validator.

### Evaluation Protocol
Given the non-determinism of an animation output, an evaluation mechanism which considers multiple parameters will be implemented in a phased approach. Read up more about the evaluation mechanism under [Validator documentation](./docs/validator.md) and in the [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.virtuals.io/audio-to-animation-bittensor-subnet).
