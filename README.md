## Introduction
Audio-to-Animation (A2A), also referred to as audio-driven animation, generates visuals that dynamically respond to audio inputs. This technology finds applications across a wide range of domains including gaming AI agents, livestreaming AI idols, virtual companions, metaverses, and more.

This Bittensor subnet offers a platform for democratizing the creation of an A2A model, focusing on generating animated motions based on audio cues. It leverages Bittensor's Yuma consensus
